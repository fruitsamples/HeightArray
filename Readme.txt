HeightArray

================================================================================
DESCRIPTION:

The EXT_TEXTURE_ARRAY extension introduces the notion of one and two-dimensional 
texture array, which is a collection of one and two-dimensional images of 
identical size and format, arranged in layers. This sample provides an example 
of two-dimensional texture array. It visualizes a terrain by using terrain's 
Z-coordinate to index into a texture array and applies the correct image for 
that point's elevation.

Usage: Move your mouse around to view the terrain from different camera angles.
